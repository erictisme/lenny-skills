# Lenny Skills

18 theme-based coaching journey skills powered by Lenny Rachitsky's archive (638 newsletters + podcasts). Each skill is a structured learning journey that connects 5-35 articles into a curriculum.

## How Skills Work
- Each skill is a markdown file in `skills/` that instructs Claude Code how to run a coaching session
- Skills use the Lenny MCP (`mcp.lennysdata.com/mcp`) to load articles at runtime via `mcp__lennysdata__read_content`
- Users install skills by copying `.md` files to `~/.claude/commands/`

## Content Source (for Ralph skill generation)
- `content/index.json` — master index of all 638 items
- `content/newsletters/` — 349 newsletter markdown files
- `content/podcasts/` — 289 podcast transcript markdown files
- These are gitignored — they exist locally for Ralph to read, not published

## Theme Coaching Journey Skills (Ralph Task Instructions)

When generating a theme-based coaching journey skill, follow this template EXACTLY.

**Format reference:** Tal Raviv & Aman Khan's "How to build AI product sense" — interactive 1-on-1 tutoring: motivating overview, sequential concepts, check understanding, hold high bar, signpost progress.

### How to Build a Skill

1. **Search `content/index.json`** for ALL articles matching the theme's keywords
2. **Read ALL matching articles** from `content/newsletters/` and `content/podcasts/` — not just 6-8, read everything
3. **Extract key frameworks** across all articles — find the THREAD that connects them
4. **Design a sequential learning journey** — ordered concepts, one at a time, building on each other
5. **Write the skill file** to `skills/lenny-[theme].md`

### Skill Template

```markdown
# /lenny-[theme] - [Theme Name]

[One-line pitch: what this journey covers and why it matters]

## Prerequisites
- Lenny's Data MCP connected (`mcp.lennysdata.com/mcp`)
- If MCP tools are not available: "Connect the Lenny MCP first at lennysdata.com"

## About This Journey
[2-3 sentences: what you'll learn, who it's for, what outcome to expect]
Best for: [SPECIFIC audience, e.g. "Early-stage founders pricing their product for the first time" — NOT "anyone interested in pricing"]

## The Curriculum
[Ordered list of 5-8 concepts that build on each other — each maps to 1-3 source articles]
1. **[Concept Name]** — [What you'll understand after this] *(Sources: [Article Title], [Podcast Guest Name])*
2. **[Concept Name]** — [What you'll understand] *(Sources: ...)*
3. ...

## Source Articles
[Full list of ALL article/podcast titles + filenames in this theme]
- "[Article Title]" — `[filename]`
- "[Podcast: Guest Name] on [topic]" — `[filename]`

## Coaching Session Instructions

When this skill is invoked, follow this exact flow:

### Opening
1. Give a brief, motivating overview: what we're learning and why it matters. 3-4 sentences. Make the user feel excited, not overwhelmed.
2. Show the roadmap: "We'll cover [X] concepts. Here's the journey: [list concept names]. By the end, you'll be able to [concrete outcome]."
3. Ask: "[SPECIFIC question about the user's context, tailored to this theme]"
   [Include the actual question — NOT generic "tell me your situation"]
   Example for pricing: "What are you selling, who's buying it, and what are they paying today (if anything)?"
4. Wait for their answer. Use it to personalize the entire session.

### For Each Concept (walk through in order, one at a time)
1. **Load the source:** Use `mcp__lennysdata__read_content` with filename `[article filename]` to get the full article
2. **Teach it:** Share the key insight in 3-5 sentences using the article's own words and frameworks. Cite the author/guest naturally: "As [Guest Name] puts it..." or "[Author] argues that..."
3. **Apply it:** Connect to the user's context: "For your situation, this means..."
4. **Check understanding:** Ask the user to explain it back in their own words. ONE question only. Wait for their answer.
5. **Hold the bar:** If their explanation is vague or off, gently correct: "Close, but the key nuance is..." Ask again if needed.
6. **Signpost:** "That's concept [X] of [Y]. Next up: [preview of next concept]."

### Closing
1. Ask the user for a 30-second summary of everything they learned, as if explaining to a friend.
2. Give 3 concrete next steps — specific, time-bound, doable this week.
3. For each step, cite which article/podcast backs it up with the source filename so they can read/listen in full.
4. Offer to save session notes. Ask the user where they'd like to save. Suggest `./lenny-sessions/[YYYY-MM-DD]-[theme].md` as default.

### Rules
- ONE question at a time. Wait for the answer.
- Be direct and practical. No filler, no "great question!" padding.
- Use the original words and frameworks from the articles — cite naturally.
- If the user goes on a tangent, follow briefly then redirect: "Good question — [answer]. Now back to concept [X]..."
- Keep energy up. Signpost progress regularly.
- Cover every concept in the curriculum, in order. Don't skip.
- If the user is losing energy, acknowledge it: "We're past the halfway mark. Want a quick recap before we continue?"

## Key Frameworks Cheat Sheet

```

### Quality Rules
1. **Concepts must be REAL** — extracted from actual article content, with proper citations
2. **The journey must have a logical sequence** — concepts build on each other
3. **The opening question must be SPECIFIC** to the theme (not "tell me your situation")
4. **Best For must be specific** — "B2B PMs at Series A setting first pricing tiers" not "anyone"
5. **Source Articles must list real filenames** from content/ directory
6. **Cite guests by name** for podcast episodes
7. **Cross-reference articles** — find the THREAD, don't summarize each separately
8. **Read ALL articles** in the theme, not just the top 6-8
9. **Use the articles' own language** — don't paraphrase into generic advice

### Security Constraints
Skills are distributed as markdown files that users install into `~/.claude/commands/`. They must be safe and transparent:

1. **No bash/shell commands.** Skills must NEVER instruct Claude to run bash commands, curl, wget, or any shell execution. Read-only MCP tool calls are the only external interaction allowed.
2. **No filesystem writes without consent.** Never write files silently. Always ask the user before saving anything, and let them choose the path.
3. **No network calls beyond MCP.** Skills must not instruct Claude to fetch URLs, call APIs, or send data anywhere. The only external tool is `mcp__lennysdata__read_content` (read-only).
4. **No references to other tools/skills.** Each skill is self-contained. Don't instruct Claude to invoke other slash commands, install packages, or modify config.
5. **No data exfiltration patterns.** Never ask Claude to read, summarize, or transmit user files, environment variables, credentials, or system information.
6. **Human-readable and auditable.** Skills should be short enough that a user can read the entire file in 2-3 minutes and understand exactly what it does before installing.
